Identifying Functional and Non-Functional Requirements


**Que 1: Identify FRs and NFRs:** <br>

**Functional Requirements:** <br>
    1. Permit the librarian to add, update, inquiry members and delete members as desired. <br>
    2. Librarians are able to add, update and delete books as required. <br>
    3. Users/customers should be able to register, edit personal information, reset passwords etc. <br>
    4. A book can be ordered, reserved, or renewed by users. <br>
    5. It can be able to sort and filter the books according to the title, author, publication date etc. <br>
    6. A librarian can organize and add books. <br>
    7. When a book is overdue, the system needs to alert both the user and the librarian. <br>
    8. When books are returned, the system calculates the fee for overdue items. <br>
 <br> <br>
**Non - Functional Requirements:**  <br>
    **Usability** <br
        • Different languages can be provided based on the requirements. <br>
        • The UI should be simple enough to understand and get the relevant information without any special training. <br>
    **Accuracy** <br> 
        • The data stored about the books and the fines calculated should be correct, consistent, and reliable. <br>
    **Availability** <br> 
        • When the library is open, the System must be functional (if it is not, it must be repaired ASAP)  <br>
        • the system needs to react to the queries within a few seconds.  <br>
    **Maintainability** <br> 
        • Adding new features and changing the programme should be simple, and the software should be simple to maintain. <br>
    **Performance** <br>
        • In a decent amount of time, the Server would be able to complete the assigned task. <br>
    **Security** <br>
        • Only authorized users would have access to the system. <br> 
    **Scalability** <br>
        • The proposed system would be scalable to handle more customers/users. <br>
    **Error handling** <br>
        • Systems must be able to manage expected and unexpected errors/failures in a way that prevents information loss in long downtime. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
**Que 2: Identify scope, features and non-functional aspects of the following problem.** <br> <br>

To assist those who have incapacitating hearing loss, an Android app has to be created. About 5% of people worldwide experience this issue.  <br>
 <br>
Scope: <br>
    • This application will notify the user in urgent situations that call for quick attentiveness, such as when someone is pleading for aid or when a car is approaching from the side of the road.  <br>
    • In these circumstances, the mobile application employs artificial intelligence to recognise some frequent noises, such as automobile horns, etc.  <br>
    • For this app should be able to detect voice from its surroundings and able to detect that voice type. <br>
    • If it detects any sound related to the critical situation then it should show it to the display and do the appropriate steps. <br>
 <br>
Features: <br>
    • This Mobile application should use Artificial intelligence to detect sounds. <br>
    • The mobile application's predictions should be quite accurate in terms of latency. <br>
    • The App should alert the users when it recognizes the sounds of critical situations <br>
    • The app should use less electricity and use fewer resources.  <br>
    • When a critical issue is identified, the app should prompt the user for a reaction to make sure they have been informed. <br>
    • When a hazardous situation is detected and there is no reaction from the user, alert friends and relatives. <br>
 <br>

Non-functional aspects: <br>

    • The app should notify the user via vibrating The app's latency should be under 2 seconds.  
    • Users should be able to add new noises that the system must be able to identify. 
    • The software should be able to track users' current whereabouts, which may be shared with friends and family in an emergency. 
    • The app ought to be able to recommend alternate routes to take in order to travel in areas with less traffic.
